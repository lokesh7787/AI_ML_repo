# DataSpark: Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Global Electronics' retail data to uncover actionable insights that can enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive business growth.  The analysis covers customer demographics, purchase patterns, product performance, store operations, and the impact of currency exchange rates on sales.

## Project Overview

Global Electronics, a leading consumer electronics retailer, provided datasets containing information about their customers, products, sales, stores, and currency exchange rates. The goal of this project is to leverage this data to gain a deeper understanding of the business and identify areas for improvement.  This involves data cleaning and preprocessing, loading the data into a SQL database, performing analysis using SQL queries, and visualizing the results using Power BI.

## Business Use Cases

This analysis aims to address several key business challenges:

* **Enhanced Marketing Strategies:** Identifying key customer segments and their purchasing behavior to tailor marketing campaigns.
* **Optimized Inventory Management:** Understanding product popularity and profitability to optimize inventory levels.
* **Improved Sales Forecasting:** Analyzing sales trends and seasonality to improve sales forecasting accuracy.
* **Strategic Product Development:** Identifying product gaps and opportunities based on customer preferences and sales data.
* **Informed Store Expansion and Operations:** Evaluating store performance and geographical trends to guide store expansion and operational decisions.
* **Effective International Pricing:** Analyzing the impact of currency exchange rates on sales to develop better international pricing strategies.

## Approach

The project follows a structured approach:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation (Python):**  Data is cleaned and preprocessed using Python with libraries like Pandas and NumPy. This includes handling missing values, converting data types, and merging datasets.
2. **Data Loading (SQL):** The cleaned data is loaded into a MySQL database. Tables are created for each data source, and data is inserted using SQL `INSERT` statements.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL):** SQL queries are used to extract key insights from the data, addressing the business use cases outlined above.
4. **Data Visualization (Power BI):** Power BI is used to create interactive dashboards and visualizations to communicate the findings of the analysis effectively.

## Datasets

The following datasets were used in this project:

* `Sales.csv`: Contains sales transaction data.
* `Customers.csv`: Contains customer demographic information.
* `Products.csv`: Contains product details.
* `Stores.csv`: Contains store information.
* `Exchange Rates.csv`: Contains currency exchange rate data.
* `EDA.ipynb`: Here handling data cleaning and feature enginering 

(You can add a table here describing the fields in each CSV if you'd like).

## Project Deliverables

* **Cleaned Data (CSV):** The cleaned and merged data ready for analysis.  (If you're including this, specify the file name).
* **SQL Database Schema:** The SQL script used to create the database and tables. (If you're including this).
* **Power BI Report (pbix):** The interactive Power BI report containing the visualizations and analysis. (If you're including this).

## Technical Skills

This project demonstrates the following technical skills:

* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (Python, Pandas, NumPy)**
* **Data Management (SQL, MySQL)**
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL)**
* **Data Visualization (Power BI)**
* **Retail Analytics**

## Analysis Steps (Brief Overview)

The analysis covers the following areas:

* **Customer Analysis:** Demographic distribution, purchase patterns, customer segmentation.
* **Sales Analysis:** Overall sales performance, sales by product, store, and currency.
* **Product Analysis:** Product popularity, profitability, category analysis.
* **Store Analysis:** Store performance, geographical analysis.
